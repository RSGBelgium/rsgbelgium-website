RSG Belgium, the regional student group of the International Society for Computational Biology, kindly invites you to the 2019 Bioinformatics Student Symposium. The main goal of this event is to provide a forum for young researchers and students in bioinformatics where they can present their work, get updated about current research topics and network with their peers.

This year the symposium will take place on Friday 03/05/2019 at the Arenberg Castle ([Arenbergkasteel](https://www.kuleuven.be/kulag/en/gebouw/432-01)) of KU Leuven.
