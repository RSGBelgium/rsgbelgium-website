RSG Belgium is excited to announce the first RSG Belgium Hackathon, which will take place in Brussels on the 16th of November 2018.

This event represents a good opportunity for MSc/PhD students from all scientific backgrounds to improve their problem solving, teamwork and coding skills by working together as a multidisciplinary team.

## Projects

### Mining Citation Networks

Scientific literature keeps growing at an alarming rate and it quickly becomes almost impossible to find relevant information for your research field. Especially given the increasingly multidisciplinary nature of research, it is crucial that relevant scientific results can be quickly and easily accessed. Therefore, the goal of this project is to facilitate this process by mining scientific literature citation networks and highlighting the underlying patterns. Additionally, emergent information could by gained by text mining these papers’ abstracts and integrating them into the network.

### What is the Kardashian Index (K-Index) of your bioinformatics research?

We have all experienced this, the lousy work of your competitor is all over social media, while your recent brilliant paper was barely noticed. But does this actually mean anything … academically speaking? By collecting various social media parameters, e.g. altmetric, retweets, reads, news coverage, etc., and comparing this to the academic side of things, e.g. the impact factor of papers, their citations and their "robustness" in research, we can find patterns or correlations between the academic impact and the broader circulation of the research.

### Twitterbot

Keeping track of the research or available datasets in your field is always a challenge. What if you had your personal Twitter bot to take care of this for you? In this project we will code a bot covering your topic of interest, in the LactoBot style (https://twitter.com/Lactobot).

### Generating an AI-written bioinformatics paper

There have been many examples of AI-generated papers, mostly in the domain of computer science. In this project we will generate such an AI-written bioinformatics paper using for example Markov chains or recurrent neural networks. Tasks involve the generation of text and graphics, the collection of relevant examples, etc.
