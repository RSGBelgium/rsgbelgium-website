# Welcome!

**RSG Belgium** is the Belgian branch of the 
[ISCB Student Councilâ€™s Regional Student Groups](https://www.iscbsc.org/).

# Our mission

**RSG Belgium** wants to bring bioinformatics and computational 
biology students from *different institutions* together and offer them
additional opportunities which can contribute to the development of 
their scientific career. 

# Our values

- Stimulate *interaction and co-operativity* between the students of 
  different research institutions
- Bring students in contact with research happening at an 
  *international level* to allow them to visualize their work in a
  much larger scope
- Provide concrete examples of how their work might benefit the 
  *industry* and 
  
In this way, we aim to stimulate the *startup of projects* that cross
the traditional boundaries of academic research.
