**RSG Belgium** wants to bring bioinformatics and computational biology students from *different institutions* together and offer them additional opportunities which can contribute to the development of their scientific career. Our primary goal in this is to stimulate *interaction and co-operativity* between the students of different research institutions. Furthermore we also bring students in contact with research happening at an *international level* to allow them to visualize their work in a much larger scope and with corporate world to provide concrete examples of how their work might benefit the *industry*. In this way, we aim to stimulate the *startup of projects* that cross the traditional boundaries of academic research.
